# 4school_district_analysis
This is an analysis of school district standardized test scores

## Overview

## Analysis

I was given the task of analyzing the city school district standardized test scores. Once analyzed, I was able display the data so that the district board would be able to notcie trends and make predictions based on how they spend budget money.

Main conclusions that were drawn from the analysis
1. Average scores and passing percentages for the entire district
2. District budget
3. Top 5 schools based on overall passing percentages
4. Bottom 5 school beased on overall passing percentages
5. Average scores and passing percentages based on school spending per student
6. Average scores and passing percentages based on amount of student at each school
7. Average scores and passing percentages based on the type of school

## Summary

### Key takeaways from the school district data analysis

- The top school in terms of standardized tests is Cabrera High School
- The bottom school in terms of standardized tests is Johnson High School
- The top 5 school in the district are charter schools
- The bottom 5 school in the district are district schools
- The schools spending the least amount of budget money per student have the highest test scores
- The schools spending the most amount of budget money per student have the lowest test scores
- Schools with between 2000 and 5000 student on average have the lowest test scores

### Skewed numbers

While doing my analysis I saw that, as charter school, Thomas High School had very low test numbers and was somewhat of an outlier based on their school type. After realizing this I removed the 9th grade class from their data and it revealed that that one class of students was heavily skewing their test score data. I think that this is something that is very important to take into account when looking at the data because there can possibly be something happening at this school that is causing the freshman class to struggle that needs to be addressed.
